# CompetitionOfLife
 
Competition of Life is a variation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It follows the same rules except that you can add a cell to expand your empire! Face off against the AI to see if you can have more cells at the end of each match!
<br />

Each match lasts 10 turns and you press the Solve Turn button to finalize your turn. After 10 turns a popup box will appear and state the scores and the winner. When you press OK, a new match will begin.
